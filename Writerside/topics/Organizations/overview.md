>Within Organizations, There are Users and Teams.
A User cannot be Assigned to a Project without belonging to a Team. There is a default Team created, when an
Organization is created.

## There are a couple of things to keep in mind:
<list>
    <li> Organizations are Intrinsically linked to domain-name</li>
    <li> When a user registers with a business email, a default ORG is
    created, by using the domain name. In the case of an <b>exigent-group.com</b>
    email, the Organization name will be <b>Exigent-Group</b>.</li>
    <li> When a user registers with a <b>@gmail.com</b> email address, a random Organization name will be generated. 
(This can be changed) </li>
</list>
